## Question 2

Write the SOS game that is playable by 2 players. More information can be found on: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_(game)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_(game)</a>

Include the following requirements:
* The game should be split up into multiple files.
* The game should be compiled using a makefile.
* A user can specify the size of board that they want to play on (nxm).
* The number of SOS points should be counted per player.
* The game ends when the entire board is filled and the winner is declared.
* One should be able to do a rematch.

Bonus (+10): Give the option for a player to play against the computer. Have the computer play relatively smart (i.e. if there is a chance to get an SOS, it will go for it!). Describe how you made the computer player in this README.
