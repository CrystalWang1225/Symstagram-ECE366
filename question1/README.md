## Question 1

Extend the tic-tac-toe game that we went over in class with the following additional requirements:
* Split up the program into multiple logical .c and .h files.
* Create a make file in order to compile the game.
* Keep track of how many wins the player and the computer won for the duration of the program.
* Allow a user to specify a tournament mode where the winner is determined by winning the best out of x games.

This question is 50 points (25 pts for quality & 25 pts for output).

Bonus (+10): 
* Allow a user to specify the board to nxn.
* Modify the win condition to check for 3 X's or 3 O's in a row, column, or diagonal in the nxn tic-tac-toe board.
* Modify the computer_move function to play more intelligently on a 4x4 or 5x5 board.
